# Experiments Guide

### Description

This guide is intended to serve as a resource for individuals interested in the
design and analysis of experiments. While its scope will encompass
experimentation generally, particular attention will be paid to the
considerations specific to online settings.

The goal of this guide is to help individuals understand causality in the
context of randomized experimentation. It will cover the mechanics of
experiments, focusing on how randomization solves the causal-inference problem,
how to assess the validity of experimental designs, and how to deal with
complications in experiments. In addition, it will address topics such as
determining sample size, establishing experimental duration, and testing
multiple conditions. To address the analysis component, this guide will cover
sampling distributions, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and using
covariates with experimental data.

This will be presented as a set of Jupyter notebooks with text, formulae, and
code examples, where possible.

### Motivation

This guide was created in order to formalize and share my understanding and
enthusiasm for experimentation. It was first developed as part of an
independent study course while I was a graduate student at the School of
Information at the University of California, Berkeley.
