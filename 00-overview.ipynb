    "In many cases, albeit for different reasons, it may be important to make inferences about the effects of particular interventions. For example, we may be interested in understanding the efficacy of medical treatments, the effects of education programs on student outcomes, or the impacts of web products or features on particular business metrics. There are several ways in which we could make inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to rely on intuition or anecdotes. However, this is problematic because examples supporting particular views might be readily available or, worse yet, because they might be open to interpretation, may be made to favor a particular argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to gather available data on factors that are believed to influence particular outcomes and to analyze their relationships. However, these relationships may not&mdash;and, often times, cannot&mdash;imply anything about causality. This could be due, for example, to *unobserved* factors that are correlated with a particular outcome but are not measured or are measured incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example in labor economics deals with \"returns to education,\" which tries to measure the impact that additional schooling has on wages. Common unobserved factors in this context are ability and motivation. It's not controversial to think that the reasons why particular individuals choose (or have the opportunity) to get additional schooling could relate to or affect future wages. The problem with unobserved factors is that they may not be completely enumerable or even available.\n",

    "The approach that gives us the best ability to assess causal claims and, thus, to be able to make better inferences, is experimentation."

Consider an experiment where a teaching method is applied to *classrooms*. The classrooms, in this case, because they are the objects to which treatments are assigned, are the experimental units. The outcomes of interest (e.g., test scores), on the other hand, are measured for individual students. They are the measurement units."

Good designs avoid systematic error, are precise, allow for the estimation of error, and have broad validity (Oehlert, 2010)."
