    "The causal effect of a treatment, $D$, on an outcome, $y$, for either an observational *or* experimental unit, $i$, is defined by the differences in outcomes occurring under each of the treatment possibilities (Gelman, 2006). In the binary treatment case, $D_i = \\left\\{0, 1\\right\\}$. The potential outcomes&mdash;that is, the outcomes that would have been observed for unit $i$ under treatment and control conditions&mdash;are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "    y_{1i} \\quad \\text{if}\\ D_i = 1 \\\\\n",
    "    y_{0i} \\quad \\text{if}\\ D_i = 0\\text{.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one of the outcomes&mdash;the one associated with unit $i$'s assignment&mdash;is ever observed, though. For a unit assigned to the treatment condition, $y_{1i}$ is observed and $y_{0i}$, referred to as the *counterfactual*, is unobserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the potential outcomes notation, the observed outcome, $y_i$, can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{0i} + (y_{1i} - y_{0i})D_i\\text{,}$$\n",

    "Because both potential outcomes are never observed for a single unit, treatment effects must be inferred by comparing average outcomes for treated and untreated units."
