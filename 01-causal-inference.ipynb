    "The causal effect of a treatment, $D$, on an outcome, $y$, for either an observational *or* experimental unit, $i$, is defined by the differences in outcomes occurring under each of the treatment possibilities (Gelman, 2006). In the binary treatment case, $D_i = \\left\\{0, 1\\right\\}$. The potential outcomes&mdash;that is, the outcomes that would have been observed for unit $i$ under treatment *and* control conditions&mdash;are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "    y_{1i} \\quad \\text{if}\\ D_i = 1 \\\\\n",
    "    y_{0i} \\quad \\text{if}\\ D_i = 0\\text{.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one of the outcomes&mdash;the one associated with unit $i$'s assignment&mdash;is ever observed, though. For a unit assigned to the treatment condition, $y_{1i}$ is observed and $y_{0i}$, referred to as the *counterfactual*, is unobserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the potential outcomes notation, the observed outcome, $y_i$, can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{0i} + (y_{1i} - y_{0i})D_i\\text{,}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_{1i} - y_{0i}$ is the causal effect of the treatment, $D$, on unit $i$ (Angrist and Pischke, 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the *average treatment effect*, or ATE, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ATE \\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (y_{1i} - y_{0i})\\text{.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both potential outcomes are never observed for a single unit, though, treatment effects must be inferred by comparing average outcomes for treated and untreated units, resulting in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N y_{1i} - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N y_{0i}\\text{.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to express the this is using *expected value* notation. For a random variable, $X$, its expected value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \\dots + x_kp_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_ip_i\\text{,}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_i$ is the probability of seeing $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite the ATE formula in terms of conditional expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[y_i \\mid D_i=1] - E[y_i \\mid D_i=0]\\text{.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the difference in expected outcomes for treated and untreated units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our medical treatment study example where the treatment is only administered to patients who need it most. A naive comparison of outcomes for treated and untreated units, in this example, tells us something about potential outcomes, but not necessarily what we want to know&mdash;the effect of the treatment (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). The ATE, in this case, is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underbrace{E[y_{1i} \\mid D_i=1] - E[y_{0i} \\mid D_i=1]}_\\text{Average treatment effect on the treated} + \n",
    "\\underbrace{E[y_{0i} \\mid D_i=1] - E[y_{0i} \\mid D_i=0]}_\\text{Selection bias}\\text{.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $E[y_{1i} \\mid D_i=1] - E[y_{0i} \\mid D_i=1]$ represents the difference in average outcomes for those who were treated and what would have happened to them had they not been treated. To this causal effect, we add a term called *selection bias*. This represents the difference in average $y_{0i}$&mdashthat is, outcomes we would have observed without treatment&mdash;between those who were and weren't treated. In our example, because those who were treated were of the highest need, their observed outcomes, whatever they might be (we have said nothing about the response), are presumably worse than those who weren't treated, making selection bias negative."
