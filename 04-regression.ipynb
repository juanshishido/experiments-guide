    "A regression model typically describes a single variable in terms of one or more different variables. A line, for example, can be described by the equation $y = mx + b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept and $m$ is the slope. In other words, this equation describes the relationship between $x$ and $y$ in terms of $m$ and $b$. The objective is to determine the value of $m$, which tells us how much $y$ increases as $x$ increases by one unit.\n",
